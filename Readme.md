# MastodonKit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ornithocoder/MastodonKit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ornithocoder/MastodonKit) [![Code Coverage](http://codecov.io/github/ornithocoder/MastodonKit/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg)](http://codecov.io/github/ornithocoder/MastodonKit)

MastodonKit is a Swift Framework built using Swift Package Manager that wraps the Mastodon API. Its goal is to cover all the entities and endpoints from [Mastodon's API](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-the-API/API.md).

## Building it from source

MastodonKit uses the Swift Package Manager and can be built and tested using the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ornithocoder/MastodonKit.git
$ cd MastodonKit
$ swift build
$ swift test
```

If you prefer, Swift Package Manager can create an Xcode Project:

```
$ swift package generate-xcodeproj
$ open MastodonKit.xcodeproj
```

## Initializing the client

Assuming you already have an access token for a user on the given Mastodon instance:

```swift
let client = Client(
    baseURL: "https://mastodon.technology",
    accessToken: "user access token (after OAuth login)"
)
```

Shall you need to get an access token, you must first register the application against the given Mastodon instance. Registering an application returns the Client ID and Client Secret needed to perform the OAuth call. Remember to store the Client ID and Client Secret locally in your application for future OAuth logins:

```swift
let client = Client(baseURL: "https://mastodon.technology")

let resource = Clients.register(
    clientName: "MastodonKit Test Client",
    scopes: [.read, .write, .follow],
    website: "https://github.com/ornithocoder/MastodonKit"
)

client.run(resource) { application, error in
    if let application = application {
        print("id: \(application.id)")
        print("redirect uri: \(application.redirectURI)")
        print("client id: \(application.clientID)")
        print("client secret: \(application.clientSecret)")
    }
}
```

After retrieving the access token (via standard OAuth 2 authorization flow), update the MastodonKit client with the returned accessToken:

```swift
client.accessToken = "user access token (after OAuth login)"
```

**Side note**: Mastodon's API and MastodonKit offer a way to silently log a user in, but the method is discouraged. The [API documentation](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-the-API/Testing-with-cURL.md) recommends using the standard OAuth 2 authorization flow instead.

> _"Please note that the password-based approach is not recommended especially if you're dealing with other user's accounts and not just your own. Usually you would use the authorization grant approach where you redirect the user to a web page on the original site where they can login and authorize the application and are then redirected back to your application with an access code."_ - Mastodon's API Documentation

But in case you want to test it with your own account, here is how:

```swift
let loginResource = Login.silent(
    clientID: "very long client id",
    clientSecret: "very long client secret",
    scope: .read,
    username: "foo",
    password: "bar")

client.run(loginResource) { loginSettings, error in
    if let loginSettings = loginSettings {
        print("access token: \(loginSettings.accessToken)")
    }
}
```

Bear in mind the method above should never be used when deadling with other user's accounts.

## Making requests

To make requests, create a resource and *run* it using the client. Two examples:

Getting the home timeline:

```swift
let resource = Timelines.home()

client.run(resource) { statuses, error in
    // do something with 'statuses'
}
```

Posting a new status:

```swift
let resource = Statuses.create("Mastodon's API is awesome!")

client.run(resource) { status, error in
    // do something with 'status'
}
```

## Range and Limit

Some resources take an optional `ResourceRange` parameter. This parameter should be used to specify the range of IDs to get and the number of entities to fetch. The possible options are:

* `.since(id: Int, limit: Int?)`: Gets a list with IDs less than or equal this value.
    * Note: Passing `nil` as `limit` asks Mastodon to return the default number of entities for that endpoint.
* `.max(id: Int, limit: Int?)`: Gets a list with IDs greater than this value.
    * Note: Passing `nil` as `limit` asks Mastodon to return the default number of entities for that endpoint.
* `.limit(Int)`: Sets the maximum number of entities to get.
* `.default`: Applies the default values.

Omitting the `range` paramater on the method call has the same effect of passing `.default`.

Examples:

```swift
let resource = Timelines.home(range: .since(id: 42, limit: 30))
```

```swift
let resource = Timelines.home(range: .limit(30))
```
